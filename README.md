# Blue-link
A simple bluetooth manager for your terminal.

This bluetooth manager aims to run in the background of your device, to automatically pair with known devices.
It also provides an easy-to-use CLI interface you can access with `$ blue-link`,
where you can manage known devices and connect to new ones.

# How to install

There's no package published to any package managers yet, but this might happen once the manager works well.
So for now, you'll have to install the ZIP and do it yourself (sorry :P).
