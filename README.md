# Bluelink

An easy-to-use CLI program to control your bluetooth.

This bluetooth manager aims to offer a simple way for users to control bluetooth connections through a CLI.
The service automatically connects to paired devices once they're available as well.
To access the CLI, simply run `$ bluelink` in your terminal.

Note: This was developed on Arch, so sorry if for some reason it's incompatible with other systems. I can try to fix such issues once reported.

# How to install

I'm planning to bring this package to AUR, but for now, there's a convenient setup script.
Simply download the ZIP and extract it, and run the `auto_setup.sh` (with root).
